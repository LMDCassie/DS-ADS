Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives an integer N (2≤N≤63), then followed by a line that contains all the N distinct characters and their frequencies in the following format:
c[1] f[1] c[2] f[2] ... c[N] f[N]

In our project , the input operation ends when N=0 is entered.

where c[i] is a character chosen from {'0' - '9', 'a' - 'z', 'A' - 'Z', '_'}, and f[i] is the frequency of c[i] and is an integer no more than 1000. The next line gives a positive integer M (≤1000), then followed by M student submissions. Each student submission consists of N lines, each in the format:
c[i] code[i]

where c[i] is the i-th character and code[i] is an non-empty string of no more than 63 '0's and '1's.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in each line either "Yes" if the student's submission is correct, or "No" if not.

Note: The optimal solution is not necessarily generated by Huffman algorithm. Any prefix code with code length being optimal is considered correct.
